Python Lab 3 of Fall Semester - 2016 - 2017

This lab takes a grid of numbers, and places tripods on the grid in the positions that will grant the tripod the highest value.
Each tripod gets planted on a position, with it's three legs stretching out to adjacent positions (diagonals not included).
No tripod can be placed directly on top of another, but the leg of one tripod can be on the same position as another tripod's leg.

USAGE:
	$python3 tripods.py <filename>

Where <filename> can be:
	grid.txt

Example Run:
	$python3 tripods.py grid.txt
